This is my attempt at incorporating my first blog post.

This is an example post with some [plotly](https://plotly.com/javascript/) code.

````markdown
New interactive plot below? 
````



<iframe src="/assets/plotly/model_surfaces.html" width="100%" height="600px" style="border:none;"></iframe>


````markdown
it should be above this 
````
/\and above this/\


This is how it looks like:

```plotly
{
  "data": [
    {
      "x": [1, 2, 3, 4],
      "y": [10, 15, 13, 17],
      "mode": "markers"
    },
    {
      "x": [2, 3, 4, 5],
      "y": [16, 5, 11, 9],
      "mode": "lines"
    },
    {
      "x": [1, 2, 3, 4],
      "y": [12, 9, 15, 12],
      "mode": "lines+markers"
    }
  ],
  "layout": {
    "title": {
      "text": "Line and Scatter Plot"
    }
  }
}
```
