In one notable instance, identified RNAseq as the most financially viable assay methodology for client needs, and implemented large scRNAseq and bulkRNAseq dataset analysis using Nextflow, as well as associated preprocessing and differential expression analysis. Proposed, designed, and implemented automated neural net architecture (LLM and MLP) tuning, training, and production analysis repositories for a client using Ray, PyTorch, and Scikit-learn on GPUs, cutting down client’s generation of predictive algorithms from large biological datasets from weeks to minutes/hours and maximizing recommended biomolecule feature organisms for customers by 1000%."
