Proposed, designed, and implemented automated neural net architecture (LLM and MLP) tuning, training, and production analysis repositories for a client using Ray, PyTorch, and Scikit-learn on GPUs, cutting down client’s generation of predictive algorithms from large biological datasets from weeks to minutes/hours and maximizing recommended biomolecule feature organisms for customers by 1000%."

We aimed to develop scaffold assisted crystallography techniques in an engineered protein crystal with large pores (>13 nm). Guest molecules were installed via a single covalent bond to attempt to reduce the conformational freedom and achieve high-occupancy structures. We used four different conjugation strategies to attach guest molecules to three different cysteine sites within pre-existing protein crystals. In all but one case, the presence of the adduct was obvious in the electron density. Structure determination of larger guest molecules may be feasible due to the large pores of the engineered scaffold crystals.",
