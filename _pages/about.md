Boston-based bioinformatician, and both a Marine Corps and Peace Corps veteran. 

I am all about tinkering, tuning, efficiency, excellence.  After years of lab-based work in [protein engineering](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smll.201602703), I jumped on the [computational train](https://open.bu.edu/items/f152dd51-429f-4703-be07-eddcdb51919f). I work with Boston-based biopharmaceutical startups, architecting multi-omics data pipelines to make protein property predictions. 

For consulting inquiries, email me. 

Also, I like roasting [coffee](https://www.papercranecoffeeroasters.com/) quite a bit.
