Boston-based bioinformatician, and both a Marine Corps and Peace Corps veteran. 

I am all about tinkering, tuning, efficiency, excellence.  After years of lab-based work in [protein engineering](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smll.201602703](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.bioconjchem.7b00668 ), I jumped on the [computational train](https://open.bu.edu/items/f152dd51-429f-4703-be07-eddcdb51919f ). I work with Boston-based biopharmaceutical startups, architecting multi-omics data pipelines to make protein property predictions. 

For consulting inquiries, email me. 

Also, I like roasting [coffee](https://www.papercranecoffeeroasters.com/) quite a bit.

I have a bit of a non-traditional background: after serving in the Marine Corps, going to college on the GI Bill, and serving in the Peace Corps in Ethiopia doing health advocacy work, I worked for several years on protein engineering projects in Boston-based biotech startups (including Joyn Bio, now folded into Ginkgo Bioworks, and Resonance Medicine, one of David Liu's more recent projects). A longtime advocate and point person for incorporating scalable and automated processes into bioengineering projects, I decided to turn down a PhD offer at SUNY to complete an accelerated one-year- Master's in Biomedical Engineering at BU because I was excited at the prospect of fleshing out my computational skills and immediately transferring those skills into real-world applications sooner rather than later. Since completing my Master's about a year ago, I've been consulting as a bioinformatics ML/AI engineer for a few other Boston-based biotech startups focused on protein engineering applications in biomedical advances. 

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
